I will use the Firebase platform to create Web applications, implement and deploy a chat client using Firebase.

The basic applications of this app is to send and receive messages(including images). It also can receive notifications when the app is in the background.

Then some advanced applications will be added to this web app. 
Such as:
1.welcome new users

2.Users can upload all type of images in the chat, and it can moderate offensive images

3.Notifications will be sent to participants of the chat when a new message is posted

This is the link of my web app in Firebase(Project Console):
